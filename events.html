            <h2>MARC I: Malware Analysis Report Competition I</h2>
            <p>contest page: <span style="color: rgb(223, 77, 101)">COMING SOON</span></p>
            <div>
                <p>In this competition, participants collect and analyze real malware, then write an analysis report like a story, covering the entire scope of who, what, when, where, why, and how they found and analyzed the malware.</p>
                <p>MARC I was created by Lena Yu (aka LambdaMamba) to provide malware enthusiasts with an opportunity to learn and showcase their passion and skills.</p>
                <p>Mastering malware analysis means mastering language. Essentially, we take a highly technical concept and simplify it into something that many can understand, similar to how a compiler translates high-level language into low-level language that a wide range of systems can understand.</p>
                <p>When participants open-source and publish their work, it greatly contributes to improving the field of cyber defense. Let's make malware analysis knowledge go viral!</p>

            <h2>Bombe: Battle of Malware Bypass and EDR</h2>
            <p>contest page: <span style="color: rgb(223, 77, 101)">COMING SOON</span></p>
            <div>
                <p>Try to capture malware by writing your own EDR, or become the malware to bypass detection! BOMBE (Battle of Malware Bypass and EDR) is a unique match where malware and EDR systems compete against each other inside a single VM boxing ring. </p>
                <p>Our participants can choose if they want to be malware creator or EDR developer. Malware creators aim to exfiltrate credentials and transmit them to our designated server. On the other side, EDR developers will focus on detecting the malware's activities and report its findings. Both the malware and EDR, created by our participants, will battle each other directly inside a single VM. As they face off, theyâ€™ll earn points for wins, moving up on the leaderboard. We also encourage them to keep improving their malware or EDR systems, system logs will be released after few rounds.</p>               
                <p>BOMBE was created by Wei-Chieh Chao (aka oalieno) and Tien-Chih Lin (aka Dange). It is not just a competition, it's a learning platform. Participants engage with real-world scenarios, learning the circumstances between malware and EDR, a never-ending bypass and detect game. Showcase your skills! Whether you're a wizard at weaving undetectable malware or a mastermind in sophisticated defenses, this is your stage. Demonstrate your capabilities to a global audience, including potential employers and industry leaders.</p>
